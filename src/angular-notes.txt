1) Lazy Loading
    Lazy-loading feature modules
    By default, NgModules are eagerly loaded. This means that as soon as the application loads, 
    so do all the NgModules, whether they are immediately necessary or not. For large applications 
    with lots of routes, consider lazy loading â€”a design pattern that loads NgModules as needed. Lazy
     loading helps keep initial bundle sizes smaller, which in turn helps decrease load times.

     create a new module for lazy loading

     src/app/users/ (cmd) - ng g m users --route users --module app.module
     module/users cmd - ng g c add users (create the components you want)

2) Pipes
       -> Use pipes to transform strings, currency amounts, dates, and other data for display.
       ->Pipes are simple functions to use in template expressions to accept an input value and return a transformed value. 
    Built-in pipes
        Angular provides built-in pipes for typical data transformations, including transformations for internationalization (i18n), which use locale information to format data.
        eg:
        DatePipe: Formats a date value according to locale rules.
        UpperCasePipe: Transforms text to all upper case.
        LowerCasePipe: Transforms text to all lower case.
        CurrencyPipe: Transforms a number to a currency string, formatted according to locale rules.

    User Defined pipes
        ng g p pipes/search
